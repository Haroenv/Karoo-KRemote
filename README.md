> [!WARNING]  
> This app is currently in beta stage and its main features might not work at all.


KRemote allows to use a Japanase Remote with Karoo.

## Requirements
- Japanese Remote (GXXX Remote).
- Karoo (tested on last Karoo ) with version > 

## Installation
- It's necessary to sideload this app to karoo.
- It's necessary to allow availability services, without them this app won't work.
- Press any button in the Remote to connect, you only need to open this app the first time.Kremote auto-starts when Karoo starts, then push a button in GRemote and wait until the Remote flashing green several times.

## Instructions
App autostarts every time, you only need to push de GRemote button and wait until the Remote flashing green several times.

## Buttons
Apps is configured by default:

- Left Button =>> Back Button (several actions, depends on the current Karoo screen.. back, zoom level etc).
- Right Button ==> Next screen or item. 
- Upper Button ==> Right bottom button.

## Know Bugs
- Sometimes app isn't working fine. You've to stop the app and re-start again (you can do this from karoo menu).
- You cannot change default buttons, but I'm working on it.

## Other
Remote works in all screens, I'll work in a new version where you can disallow this.
